A simple replica of FloodIt grid game (https://unixpapa.com/floodit/) done in python to understand the greedy approach and graph algorithms in 2d arrays.

There is only one file that can be run from terminal with 
##python Game.py
A single unit test that runs the complete test is written and can be tested in same way.

Tried algorithm with 2 approaches and finally the algorithm which runs better is kept, the other algorithm is still in the code(commented) in case we want to test out.
